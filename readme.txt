a calculator aimed at quickly calculating uncertainty caused by linear fitting with python and uncertainty propagation , especially useful in physics experiments.

__version__:
python 3.7.1 64-bit
sympy 1.4
scipy 1.1.0
numpy 1.15.4

pyfiles:
lfit.py : 
    uncertainty caused by linear fitting
patial_and_uncertainty_propagation.py:
    uncertainty caused by uncertainty propagation
    all formula should be in python forms.
        ex:
            sin(x) rather than sinx
            m*g rather than mg
